honkai impact 3 private server

After reversing the client for a while to reproduce almost all the features I have known from different cheat tools of honkai impact 3. Now I am more interested in making a private server. Right now I manage to make the global dispatch server, 2nd dispatch server, account server, and very basic game server so that I can log into the game and have the dashboard without talking to offical server at all.
But these are just very small parts of the task. The most challenge or tedious part is to implement hundreds of commands in network protocol. So I am going to share my work and invite people to join me to make a decent enough game server so that we can at least drive local game stages, and also pulling equipments from pools.

This is totally for study purpose only. I am not going to share any binaries but source code and guiding documents. I will not response to any usage of stuff shared here.
